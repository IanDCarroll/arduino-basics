# Arduino Basics

This project is to help you get up-and-running with Arduino, the popular open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. Once you are set up you can pair-up with the other hardware hackers at our [weekly meetups](http://www.meetup.com/la-fullstack/).

## Prerequisites

* Laptop (running macOS, Linux or Windows)
* USB Port
* [Atom](https://atom.io/) with [script package](https://atom.io/packages/script) (recommended)
* Node.js
* Arduino Uno (or compatible board)
* Breadboard
* LED Lights
* Resistors
* Jumper Cables

**Note**: If you don't have any of those, don't worry you can share with someone else at the [meetup](http://www.meetup.com/la-fullstack/). =)
