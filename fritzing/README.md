# What is Fritzing?

Fritzing is a great open source tool for anyone to teach, share, and prototype their electronic projects! It allows you to design a schematic, and thus a part, which can then be added to very professional-looking wiring diagrams. You can even design your own PCBs and have them fabricated from the files you design.<sup>[1]</sup>

It supports all major desktop OS platforms (Windows, macOS & Linux) and can be downloaded here: http://fritzing.org/download/

Consider making a [donation](http://fritzing.org/shop/donations/) if you find the tool useful.
