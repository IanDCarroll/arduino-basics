# Lesson 1

## Instructions
1. Open `j5-examples/strobe.js` in Atom
2. Plugin your Arduino
3. Make sure you have an LED in pin 13
4. `Run Script` (macOS: `âŒ˜I` or Linux: `SHIFT-CTRL-B`)

> If the LED is "strobing" then you did it!

## Troubleshooting
1. Make sure when you plug in (USB) your Arduino that lights blink fast a few times on the board
2. If you are using Linux make sure that you set added your user to the `dialout` group (see `4.` [under directions](https://github.com/jdorfman/arduino-basics#directions))
3. If you are still having issues [open up an issue](https://github.com/jdorfman/arduino-basics/issues).
